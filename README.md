**Post-Scriptum** : 

I wanna precise this is not a real project i juste wanted to see with what my computer communicate
By the way in the overview i did go on internet to have more packets to show.
(The goal is to see what packet are transmitted with no interaction so it's normal if you don't have that many packets
